    <h1>BELIEFS / VALUES</h1>
    <p>Imagination is our most divine gift. For God's sake, wield it‚Äîand make it count for good.</p>
    <p>True authenticity isn't conscious. It simply is.</p>
    <p>Brilliance without kindness holds no value for me. I reserve my admiration for those who pair their intelligence with genuine respect for others.</p>
    <p>Disagreeableness is a fantastic trait to have. How can you improve the world if you have no beef with it?</p>
    <p>Write down your hunches. History's greatest innovations, like the Web, emerged from scattered insights collected over decades. A good idea usually never comes as an epiphany. </p>
    <p>Everyone has something to teach us. The belief that anyone is 'beneath' conversation isn't just arrogant‚Äîit's self-limiting.</p>
    <p>Tell people you love them, even if the time is ‚Äúnever right.‚Äù Also, say goodnight always.</p>
    <p>Enter meditation empty-handed. Just as your body naturally breathes and your heart naturally beats, let your mind naturally flow. Gift yourself 30 minutes daily to simply be‚Äîand watch what unfolds.</p>
    <p>Gaslighting yourself is good. Like wdym I can‚Äôt do gymnastics when I‚Äôm 90, win the Timoth√©e Chalamet look-alike contest, become a dinosaur when I grow up, AND colonize uranus...ü§®ü§®ü§® </p>
    <p>The best leaders are people whose mission is to make other people leaders.</p>
    <p>Go ahead and judge the hell out of it. Just make sure you've done your homework and really thought it through first.</p>
    <p>Live as though you give all your fucks, but also no fucks.</p>
    <p>Having a food coma with someone may be the best way to bond with them. That was how I first became friends with some of my closest friends today.</p>
    <p>I like to keep most things private, but not secret.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the day, define something to be excited about. For me, watching 2017 Troye Sivan on YouTube typically does it, aside from the things I mentionned on my main page.</p>
    <p>Be a girl's girl.</p>
