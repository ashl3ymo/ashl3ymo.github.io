    <h1>BELIEFS / VALUES</h1>
    <p>Imagination is one of humankind's greatest gifts. For God's sake, USE IT. For good, I hope.</p>
    <p>If you‚Äôre trying to ‚Äúbe authentic‚Äù you‚Äôre already not authentic.</p>
    <p>I don‚Äôt care how intellectually intelligent you are. If you don‚Äôt have emotional intelligence and don‚Äôt treat people with kindness and respect, I cannot look up to you.</p>
    <p>You can learn something from everybody, even a homeless person. I don‚Äôt believe in the phrase ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not worthy/special enough to talk to.‚Äù</p>
    <p>Girl, let those emotions out! People are too fake imo these days üôÑ</p>
    <p>Tell people you love them, even if the time is ‚Äúnever right.‚Äù Also say goodnight always.</p>
    <p>Go into meditation with ZERO intentions. Let the brain brain just like how the body bodies and the breath breaths.
      Simply allow yourself to do nothing and the mind to do what it wants for 30 min a day. Observe.</p>
    <p>Gaslighting yourself is good. Like wdym I can‚Äôt do gymnastics when I‚Äôm 90, win the Timoth√©e Chalamet look-alike contest, become a dinosaur when I grow up, AND colonize uranus...ü§®ü§®ü§® </p>
    <p>The best leaders are people whose mission is to make other people leaders.</p>
    <p>Good mental health. This sounds like a no-brainer, but it‚Äôs HUMILIATING how many people (including me) don‚Äôt prioritize this all the time.</p>
    <p>Don't be afraid to judge TF out of something. Of course, this is after you've done your research and some deep independent thinking.</p>
    <p>Live as though you give all your fucks, but also no fucks.</p>
    <p>There's a difference between not sugar-coated feedback and being rude. It's in the way you deliver it, not the actual content.</p>
    <p>Having a food coma with someone may be the best way to bond with them. That was how I first became friends with some of my closest friends today.</p>
    <p>I like to keep most things private, but not secret.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of the day, define something to be excited about. For me, watching 2017 Troye Sivan on YouTube typically does it, aside from the things I mentionned on my main page.</p>
    <p>‚ÄúMedicine, law, business, engineering, these are all noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.‚Äù ‚Äï Dead Poet‚Äôs Society</p>
    <p>Be a girl's girl.</p>
